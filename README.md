# üß† THE THIRD EYE PROJECT üîçüé•

An AI-powered real-time surveillance system that combines object detection, human pose estimation, and sequence prediction to identify potentially suspicious or dangerous behavior in a monitored area.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **YOLOv8** for real-time weapon detection
- ‚úÖ **MediaPipe** for human pose estimation
- ‚úÖ **ResNet50** for feature extraction
- ‚úÖ **LSTM** network for behavioral pattern recognition
- ‚úÖ Real-time alert system on detecting suspicious activity
- ‚úÖ Works with live webcam or video files

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `TensorFlow` / `Keras`
- `OpenCV`
- `MediaPipe`
- `YOLOv8` via `ultralytics`
- `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`

## üìÅ Dataset Structure

You need a dataset organized like this:

```

weapon-detection.v1i.createml/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ img1.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ valid/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ imgA.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

````

- Images in `train/` are labeled **positive (1)** ‚Äî e.g., suspicious.
- Images in `valid/` are labeled **negative (0)** ‚Äî e.g., normal activity.

## üß™ How It Works

1. üîç **YOLOv8** detects weapons like knives or guns in frames.
2. üèÉ **MediaPipe** tracks human pose.
3. üß† A **ResNet50** model extracts spatial features from video frames.
4. üßÆ A **stacked LSTM** analyzes feature sequences over time to classify behavior.
5. üö® If LSTM predicts suspicious behavior, an **alert** is displayed on screen.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project

### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow ultralytics numpy scikit-learn
````

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Live Surveillance

Edit the dataset path in `main`:

```python
DATASET_PATH = r"your_dataset_path_here"
```

Then run:

```bash
python THE\ THIRD\ EYE\ PROJECT.py
```

* Press `q` to exit the live feed.

## üéØ Applications

* Public safety in transportation hubs, malls, schools, and airports
* Behavior monitoring in high-risk zones
* Intelligent alert systems for security teams

---

## üß† Model Training

The project automatically:

* Extracts image features using ResNet50
* Prepares time-series data
* Trains LSTM on suspicious vs. normal behavior
* Starts real-time prediction
